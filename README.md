# :sparkles: Pre Mod 1: Practice Coding Challenges :sparkles:


Now that we have made it through Mod 0 and have some time between now and the beginning of Mod 1, we have created
a page that allows upcoming Mod 1 students the oppportunity to work on some _challenge problems_ that have been created by 
other students!

The problems will vary in their scope and complexiety, yet should largely be made up of material that applys the skills developed during 
the Mod 0 curriculum. While it is acceptable to post practice problems that you may have encoumtered outside of class & homework, we encourage 
everyone to somewhat modify the problems (variables, conditionals, arrays, etc.). Hopefully by creating your own problem for others to solve, we will 
reinforce what we have learned and allow for more peer-peer engagement/community collaboration & practice before Mod 1 begins!


## Some considerations for creating your coding challanges

1. The challenge does not have to be hard, challenge yourself by creating a problem.
    - Test your problem to make sure it works.  *üß™*
    - Pick a coding topic that you don't feel 100% about. This will hopefully challenge you to learn it better! üßê
    - Collaborate with someone on your problem, OR add to an existing one!
    - Practive writing your problem in a conscice manner that doesn‚Äôt give to much away, but isn't to vague!
    

2. Ask for help if your stuck on making your desired problem work!
3. Make as many problems as you want!
4. Feel free to add some *challenges* to your problem.
    - This may be incorporating a new, but attainable bit of coding relative to what was learned in Mod 0!

5. HAVE FUN ü§© ü•≥!
