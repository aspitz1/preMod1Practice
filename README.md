- Fork this madness and get it into your local repo *ü•≥*
- Commit all your code and check your's against others' solutions!
- Pull request your challange problems in a README.md file with a TITLE to get them posted to the base branch!

## Overview

Now that we have made it through Mod 0 and have some time between now and the beginning of Mod 1, we have decided to create
a page that allows upcoming Mod 1 students the oppportunity to work on some __challenge problems__ created by 
other students!

The problems will vary in their scope and complexiety, yet should largely be made up of material that applys the skills developed during 
the Mod 0 curriculum. While it is acceptable to post practice problems that you may have encoumtered outside of class & homework, we encourage 
everyone to modify the problems (variables, conditionals, arrays, etc.). Hopefully by creating your own problem(s) for others to solve, we will 
reinforce what we have collectively learned. Also, we can create more peer-peer engagement/community collaboration & practice before Mod 1 begins!


## Some considerations for creating your coding challanges

1. The challenge DOES NOT have to be hard, simply challenge yourself by creating a fun problem.
    - Test your problem to make sure it works.  *üß™*
    - Pick a coding topic that you don't feel 100% about. This will hopefully challenge you to learn it better! üßê
    - Collaborate with someone on your problem, OR add to an existing one!
    - Practice writing your problem in a concise manner that doesn‚Äôt give to much away, but isn't to vague!
    

2. Ask for help if you're stuck trying to make your desired problem work!
3. Make and/or solve as many problems as you want!
4. Feel free to add some * bonus challenges* to your problem. 
    - This should incorporate some new, but attainable bit of coding relative to what was learned in Mod 0!

5. HAVE FUN ü§© ü•≥!
